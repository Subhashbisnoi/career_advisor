# OAuth Configuration Fix Instructions

## The Problem
You're seeing this error: `[GSI_LOGGER]: The given origin is not allowed for the given client ID`

This happens because your Google OAuth client ID (`300902081457-9kfrv1j0o87gqvm9o7bdn05cp5f817ee.apps.googleusercontent.com`) is not configured to allow `localhost:3000` as an authorized origin.

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Update Google Cloud Console (Recommended)
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
3. Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID (`300902081457-9kfrv1j0o87gqvm9o7bdn05cp5f817ee.apps.googleusercontent.com`)
4. Click on it to edit
5. Under "Authorized JavaScript origins", add:
   - `http://localhost:3000`
   - `http://localhost:8000`
6. Under "Authorized redirect URIs", add:
   - `http://localhost:3000`
   - `http://localhost:8000/auth/google/callback`
7. Click "Save"

### Option 2: Create a New OAuth Client for Development
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
3. Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
4. Select "Web application"
5. Name it "Interviewer Local Dev"
6. Add Authorized JavaScript origins:
   - `http://localhost:3000`
   - `http://localhost:8000`
7. Add Authorized redirect URIs:
   - `http://localhost:3000`
   - `http://localhost:8000/auth/google/callback`
8. Copy the new Client ID and update your .env files

### Option 3: Use Alternative OAuth Provider (Temporary)
You can temporarily disable Google OAuth and use GitHub OAuth instead, which appears to be properly configured in your project.

## After Fixing OAuth

Once you've updated the Google Cloud Console:

1. **Restart your development servers:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd backend
   python main.py
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend  
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Clear browser cache and cookies** for localhost to ensure no cached OAuth state

3. **Test the login flow** - the Google OAuth should now work without errors

## Verification
The OAuth is working correctly when:
- âœ… No `[GSI_LOGGER]` errors in browser console
- âœ… Google login button appears and functions
- âœ… Users can successfully authenticate with Google
- âœ… Users are redirected properly after authentication

## Current Status of Restored Features

I have successfully restored all the enhancements we made in this chat session:

### âœ… Assessment System Fixes
- **Comprehensive debugging** in `backend/api/assessment.py`
- **Scenario question support** in `frontend/src/components/Assessment.js`  
- **Proper form submission** with correct URL endpoints
- **Detailed logging** for troubleshooting authentication and submission issues

### âœ… Career Recommendations System
- **Structured LLM output** using Pydantic models in `backend/api/careers.py`
- **Enhanced AI prompts** for Indian job market context
- **Fallback recommendations** for reliable functionality
- **Career recommendation generation** integrated with assessment workflow

### âœ… Dashboard Integration
- **Career recommendations display** in `frontend/src/components/Dashboard.js`
- **Assessment history** with proper status indicators
- **Statistics and metrics** from actual user data
- **Navigation to roadmaps** and career exploration

### âœ… Enhanced Roadmap Generation
- **Structured roadmap generation** with Pydantic models in `backend/api/roadmap.py`
- **Comprehensive milestone tracking** with timelines and deliverables
- **Resource categorization** (books, courses, certifications, etc.)
- **Career preparation guidance** including portfolio and networking

### ðŸ”§ Remaining Issue: OAuth Configuration
- OAuth client ID needs to be configured in Google Cloud Console
- This is the only blocking issue preventing full functionality
- All other enhancements are restored and ready to work

## Next Steps
1. **Fix OAuth configuration** using Option 1 or 2 above
2. **Test the complete flow**: Authentication â†’ Assessment â†’ Recommendations â†’ Dashboard â†’ Roadmaps
3. **Enjoy the enhanced career assessment system** with all the improvements we implemented!

All the work from our chat session has been successfully restored. Once you fix the OAuth configuration, you'll have a fully functional system with comprehensive debugging, structured AI output, and integrated career recommendations.
